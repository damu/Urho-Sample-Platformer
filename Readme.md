# Urho Sample Platformer

I always wanted to do a 3D one with speedrunning in mind. Mario 64 is the first 3D Mario and so nice because its the most open world mario and one can do so many acrobatic tricks to shorten routes. The order of everything can be quite freely choosen and is not so pre-determind as in later Mario games.

One of the key mechanics is speed gathering: the player can gain very high speed by falling or sliding down slopes and use that to run much faster and make longer jumps.
One of my ideas is to use the Urho editor (still haven't used it) to create the levels and place certain targets that need to be collected. The order (in which to collect the targets) should be more or less free and the time needed should be displayed at the end to make it "race-ish". Though chaining levels or make level switches possible with things in the levels would also be nice to make campaigns possible (like Mario 64 with the castle as the hub world to enter the real levels). Using Lua to allow scripting the levels or modding the whole game could also be interesting. We could also play around with the gravity as they are doing with Super Mario Galaxy (when speedrunning that game, they use the small planets to make slingshot-maneuvers to shorten the levels). I really love such tricks / using the game mechanics in weird ways.

I searched on blendswap for models we could use. i haven't downloaded any yet so many may be unsuited on a closer look. I used the character category and basically filtered everything Minecraft or MLP related out and picked the mostly finished ones. (So many anime girls...)
We should take something more cartoonish to have it easier and not fall into the Uncanny Valley (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley)
